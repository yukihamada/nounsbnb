# Down NFT Sales Stopped
We've stopped Down NFT sales for now and canceled all purchases.
We will update the proposal with everyone's feedback and start sales again soon.

# 📋 Executive Summary:
We propose an investment in "Nouns House DAO," a project initiated by He Nouns 312, requiring 312 ETH in funding. In return, 10% of the token supply will be allocated to nouns.eth. Our aim is to revolutionize the property rental service by utilizing smart locks and applications, ensuring transparency and efficiency.
Leveraging the strength of the Nouns brand and the support of our community, we plan to create new opportunities through NFTs for governance, user experience, and property usage. Governance NFTs will allow community members to participate in decision-making, User NFTs will provide customers with a unique experience, and fungible tokens (FTs) will facilitate easy and efficient property usage.
We prioritize dialogue with the Nouns community and welcome an exchange of ideas through platforms like Warpcast, supporting the evolution of our project. Nouns House DAO aims to grow alongside the Nouns ecosystem, providing long-term benefits to the community.


## 🔍 What is Enabler DAO/LLC?
![yukiha](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1534818161710616576/_3wAha8i_400x400.png)

Founded by Yuki Hamada, a serial tech entrepreneur and former Executive CPO of Mercari, a unicorn company in Japan, Enabler DAO/LLC is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). To accommodate scenarios requiring formal contracts, it also holds a legal entity status in Japan in the form of an LLC, which participates as a member of the DAO. The organization currently manages luxury properties across Tokyo, Hawaii, Kyoto, and Hokkaido, operating with a profitable business model in the real estate sector. It is also in a transitional phase towards tokenization. As this investment progresses, Nouns House DAO has the potential to emerge as a key player at the intersection of blockchain and real estate. Furthermore, plans are in motion to issue utility tokens based on the existing property usage, offering special perks to NFT owners. This includes the strategy to leverage existing assets to stimulate new avenues for growth.
